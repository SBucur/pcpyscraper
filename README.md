# PC PyScraper

PC Part Picker doesn't track Microcenter, so I wrote a script that does that and lets me compare multiple builds together.

## Features
-   Define a build list of products with multiple links
-   SQLite3 DB to store recent price checks
-   Export to CSV
-   Compare build prices

## Currently supported websites
-   Amazon
-   Microcenter
